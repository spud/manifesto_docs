Manifesto is a object-oriented Content Management System (CMS) and PHP framework for managing complex structured data and rendering that content, whether as web pages, RSS reeds, iCalendar output, or a web service API.

This guide is designed to provide an overview of Manifesto as it is used to manage a large website. It covers the principles of Manifesto and specific guides for administering content from static HTML pages to recurring events and custom form creation.
