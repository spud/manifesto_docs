Models and the Object class
***************************

Functionality that involves custom data structures is implemented with models, usually based on the ManifestoObject class.

The ManifestoObject class provides a small number of properties that are common to all content in Manifesto, like unique ID numbers, creation and modification dates, and the deleted flag (which governs whether or not content is visible to the public). It also provides a number of base methods for editing, updating, saving, and deleting the content.
