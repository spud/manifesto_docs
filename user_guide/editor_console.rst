If you are responsible for adding and editing the content on your website, you will spend most of your time in the editorial backend, where you can view and modify all of the content in organized fashion.

The content on your website is broken down into modules, which are packages of files that provide some specific functionality. The Dated Posts module provides blog-like functionality, where you enter blog posts and they are displayed on the front end as a chronological list. The Template Pages module allows you to build standard HTML pages with body copy in customized layouts.

Manifesto is not a "one size fits all" CMS, where all of the content is shoehorned into a "blog posts" format. In general, each module allows you to edit and store your content in a format intentionally suited to its usage.

On the left-hand side of the Editor Console, you will see a list of the content modules enabled on your site. Clicking on the title will load the editorial landing page for that section, which may have multiple tabs for managing different types of content within that module.

For the most part, all of the sections follow a consistent format, and fall into one of 3 types of file:

- Listing pages, where all the existing content within that module is listed
   .. figure:: images/editor-view-listing.*
      :width: 800 px
      :height: 400 px
      :target: ./images/editor-view-listing.png

- Editing pages, where a form is presented to create or edit a new content object
   .. figure:: images/editor-view-editing.*
      :width: 800 px
      :height: 400 px
      :target: ./images/editor-view-editing.*

- Display pages, where rendered output from your content is displayed for your reference
   .. figure:: images/editor-view-display.*
      :width: 800 px
      :height: 400 px
      :target: ./images/editor-view-display.*
