<h1>FormBuilder<a class="headerlink" href="#formbuilder" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The FormBuilder module is a powerful, easy-to-use way to create custom forms to present to your visitors. You can create simple text inputs, checkboxes and selection menus with custom values, long text areas, file uploads, and more!</p>
<div class="figure align-right">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/formbuilder-components.png"><img alt="../_images/formbuilder-components.png" src="../_images/formbuilder-components.png" style="width: 110px;" /></a>
</div>
<p>Building a form is as simple as dragging and dropping the various components into place, and configuring them with a name, label, custom values, etc. The FormBuilder module supports default values, placeholder text, introductory copy, popup help text, and other detailed features that give you control over your forms.</p>
<p>The FormBuilder module provides you with all of the different inputs that you might need to create incredibly detailed forms.</p>
<p>While FormBuilder forms can be accessed as their own independent pages, they can also be easily embedded into any Template Page using the <strong>Standalone Form</strong> template. This gives you the ability to embed powerful forms directly into pages on your site, providing a fully-integrated experience.</p>
<p>Forms are processed upon submission, and can either display a simple confirmation message that you configure (on a form-by-form basis), or can automatically redirect the user to a page of your choosing.</p>
<p>Forms responses, after being submitted by visitors, are stored in a database, and can optionally be formatted and emailed to an email address. The database stores the raw response in key-value pairs, so that even if the form is edited later to add, remove, or rename fields, each response still maintains its original information, and no responses are lost.</p>
<p>Every form response from every form is available for viewing in the Editor Console, but because two different forms will have two radically different sets of fields in them, you must select the form whose responses you wish to see before being able to peruse the listing of responses. Because of the complexity of creating an interface that allows you to sort the responses in various ways, Manifesto offers the ability to export and download a version of the form responses in a way that allows you to open them as a spreadsheet (e.g. in Excel), where the data can be manipulated any way you want.</p>
<div class="section" id="creating-a-form">
<h2>Creating a Form<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-a-form" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To create a new form, navigate to the <strong>Form Builder</strong> section of the editorial portal. There are two tabbed sections on this page: Forms and Submissions. If you are not already on the <em>Forms</em> tab, click on it to get there.</p>
<p>At the basic level, a Manifesto form has</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A title</li>
<li>Optional introductory copy</li>
<li>A storage method (database or database + email)</li>
<li>Email address if &#8220;database + email&#8221; is selected</li>
<li><em>Either</em> &#8220;confirmation text&#8221; or a &#8220;Redirect URL&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>This last option governs whether or not, after submitting the form, the user is shown your custom message on the subsequent page, or the user&#8217;s browser is redirected to the page of your choice.</p>
<p>Once you have configured the basic properties of a FormBuilder Form, you must now configure it.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">You may also always click the &#8220;Configure&#8221; button from the listing page to edit the form fields.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="configuring-your-form">
<h2>Configuring Your Form<a class="headerlink" href="#configuring-your-form" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The form configuration interface is designed to be very easy to use, but with enough power to give you the flexibility you need. You start with an empty canvas, and drag-drop-configure each element in your form.</p>
<p>To get started, we will cover the different form components at your disposal, and describe their basic use. Options for customizing all of the fields will be covered below. <em>All forms will automatically get a &#8220;Submit&#8221; button, so there is no ability to add a button.</em></p>
<p>First, the one component you can add to your form that is <em>not</em> an input mechanism is <strong>Body Copy.</strong> You can use this field to add HTML text to your form, from a sentence to many paragraphs. (Individual fields can have introductory copy as well, but larger blocks of text, perhaps covering more than a single field, might merit using this field type.)</p>
<p>Then there are a variety of text-based input fields:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Text input:</strong> The single-line text input, for e.g. &#8220;First Name&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Integer:</strong> A whole number (good for quantities or anything that should <em>not</em> have a decimal place)</li>
<li><strong>Float-Point Number:</strong> Designed to hold a float-point number, like a price, or a precise weight</li>
<li><strong>Password:</strong> This works like the <strong>Text Input,</strong> but input will be obfuscated in the box. Please note that, while the input behaves like a password field, the input is still stored in the database in plain text, and should not be considered a secure password.</li>
<li><strong>Text Area:</strong> This provides the user with a large, WYSIWYG editor interface for entering large blocks of text, or any copy that requires line breaks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next there are selection-based input elements. All of these present the user with a predefined, limited selection of possible responses, and the user must select from among them.</p>
<p>Aside from the boolean (<em>Yes/No</em>) selections, all of these elements share a common set of methods for defining the lists they will present to the user. This is discussed later in this document. The available selection elements are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Boolean</strong> (or <em>Yes/No</em>) <strong>Checkbox:</strong>: This is presented to the user as a single checkbox with a label. If the user checks the box, its value is submitted. If the box is not checked, <strong>no indication of the field is submitted at all.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Boolean</strong> (or <em>Yes/No</em>) <strong>Radio Buttons:</strong>: This is often used to present either/or scenarios where you want a clear <em>A</em> or <em>B</em> indication, like &#8220;Company&#8221; or &#8220;Individual.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Checkboxes:</strong>: Checkboxes provide the user with the ability to select more than one answer to a particular question, e.g. &#8220;What are your favorite words?&#8221;, displaying all of the options as individual checkbox inputs. You cannot restrict the user from selecting more than one answer with this input.</li>
<li><strong>Radio Buttons:</strong>: These work exactly like checkboxes, displaying each available option as a separate input, but is structured in such a way that the user cannot select more than one option (if they select a second option, the first is automatically de-selected).</li>
<li><strong>Selection Menu:</strong>: Sometimes known as a <em>Drop-down menu.</em> This element offers a (largely browser-specific designed) menu of available options. Most of the time, the menu displays only a single line item (when inactive) and only allows a single selection, but it can also be made to behave like a multi-select list as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>Repeating Collection</strong> element can be a huge time saver, as it allows you to define a combination of fields once, and the user can create as many instances of this combination as needed via a simple button to &#8220;Add Another.&#8221; For example, a job application form might ask the applicant for:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>* Example project
* Budget
* Client
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>but you want the user to be able to add as many project/budget/client responses as they feel appropriate. This is how a repeating collection solves the need to have a predefined number of Project 1/Project 2/Project 3 fields that may be too many or may be too few. The fields within a repeating collection are slightly more restrictive than standalone form elements, but the basic options of text input, dates, and selection menus is available.</p>
<p>The fields</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Date</strong></li>
<li><strong>Date/Time</strong></li>
<li><strong>Time</strong>, and</li>
<li><strong>Year</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>are straightforward, providing selection menus for selecting dates and times.</p>
<p>The <strong>Hidden</strong> element allows you to embed a value into your form which becomes part of the submission, but is never visible by the user.</p>
<p>So these are the pieces you combine to build your form. Aside from their field types, each one has a core of associated configuration data.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="../_images/formbuilder-field-configure.png" src="../_images/formbuilder-field-configure.png" />
</div>
<ul class="simple">
<li>First, you can create multiple <em>sections</em> in your form, simply by adding a section name to your field configuration. Each section is rendered within its own <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fieldset</span></code> element, using the section name as a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">legend</span></code> element. By default, all fields are added to a &#8220;Default&#8221; section.</li>
<li>The <strong>Label</strong> for the field should provide the user with a clear definition of the input you are requesting. For simple text inputs, the label defines the input, e.g. &#8220;First Name.&#8221; For a collection of checkboxes, however, the label will cover the collection, e.g. &#8220;Hobbies,&#8221; while the individual checkboxes will have their own labels to describe themselves.</li>
<li>The <strong>Internal field name</strong> is the name actually passed by the form when it is submitted. <strong>The internal field name must be unique within your form, so having two fields with the same internal field name will produce unexpected results.</strong> The internal field name should be a short, URL-friendly formatted description of your content, e.g. &#8220;form_hobbies&#8221; rather than &#8220;form_what_are_your_favorite_hobbies?&#8221;. The &#8220;<a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">form_</span></a>&#8221; prefix is used by Manifesto to help distinguish FormBuilder fields from other commonly-used variables in Manifesto like &#8220;id&#8221; or &#8220;function.&#8221;</li>
<li>The checkbox <strong>This field is required</strong> results in the field being tagged with the HTML5 &#8220;required&#8221; attribute, which means that the form cannot be submitted until a non-empty value is entered. For checkboxes and radio buttons, checking this box will enforce a requirement that <em>at least one</em> of the options must be selected in order to submit.</li>
<li>The <strong>Placeholder</strong> text uses the HTML &#8220;placeholder&#8221; attribute to pre-populate the field input with a pre-defined value. This is especially useful when you want to provide your users with an example, or a hint as to the expected format of the response. Placeholder text is generally rendered with faint gray text, and entering text directly into the box immediately overwrites any placeholder. Placeholder text is <em>never</em> submitted, even if the input is left empty.</li>
<li>If you want the field to be pre-populated with a value that <em>will</em> be submitted, but can be changed by the user, you may enter it in the <strong>Default value or state</strong> field.</li>
</ul>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="../_images/formbuilder-field-configure-advanced.png" src="../_images/formbuilder-field-configure-advanced.png" />
</div>
<p>On the &#8220;Advanced&#8221; tab of the configuration options, there are some additional parameters for your form element.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>An <strong>Introductory Text</strong> will appear above your field. You may write as much as you need, and the text will appear below the field label, but above the input element. Useful for providing more detailed instructions on what you are asking of your users.</li>
<li>The <strong>Prefix</strong> and <strong>Suffix</strong> fields can be used to provide small bits of text before and/or after your input. The most common uses of this are for fields expected to contain prices (might use a &#8220;$&#8221; prefix), and for fields that you want to make clear are optional (might use an &#8220;(optional)&#8221; suffix.</li>
<li>The <strong>Notes</strong> field is for tooltip-like notes on the content or format of the field. It is typically presented to the user as a small circle-I which, when clicked on, reveals the note.</li>
<li>The <strong>Container Class</strong> and <strong>Element Class</strong> fields allow you to configure your element with custom classes that may be used to style the manner in which they are rendered. The <em>container class</em> is assigned to the tag of the element used as a container for the field label, input, options, etc. The <em>element class</em> is applied only to the specific element, e.g. the text input field itself, or the individual checkboxes.</li>
<li>The <strong>Validation Format</strong> menu allows you to add a particular validation check to the input. Selecting &#8220;email,&#8221; for example, will ensure that only a valid email address will be stored in the database.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">The outcome of a validation format is also dependent upon whether or not the field is marked as <strong>required.</strong> If a field with a URL validation format is <em>not</em> required, then if the user enters an invalid URL, the form will submit but  an empty value will be stored in the database. If the field is marked as <strong>required,</strong> however, the form will not submit until a valid URL is entered.</p>
