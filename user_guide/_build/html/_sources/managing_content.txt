Working with Content
********************

Content in Manifesto is managed on a per-module basis, so knowing where to find your content is the first step in managing it.

When you login to the Editor Console, the first view you see has been configured by a site adminsitrator to be the most commonly-updated content for your site. This may be the Template Pages module, or it may be a Product listing for your ecommerce store. It all depends on how your website is set up.

Below are a series of introductions and guides to the various modules used for managing content on your site.
