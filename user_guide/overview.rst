Manifesto is a Content Management System designed to provide a flexible but structured toolkit for building highly customized websites. It has a mature, modular designthat gives even novice users the ability to manage their website content with a minimal of technical understanding.

It also offers a consistent architecture that makes creating and extending new functionality easy for developers.

Manifesto Features
==================

**Consistent data structure**
   Manifesto was built with the notion that reliable, reusable, and predictable data modules are easier to work with

**Context-aware module architecture**
   Functionality is encapsulated into modules, and you have full control over how modules (and your content) interact with each other

**Flexible Template Page module**
   A basic, static HTML page that can be customized to store consistent, arbitrary structured data

**Integrated taxonomy and categorization tools**
   Tag your content with multiple categories for specific needs, or use a consistent scheme across the entire site

**Built-in User accounts**
   User management is built into the core of Manifesto, with complex permissions and a Role system for coordinating privilege levels

**Complex media management**
   Flexible media repository stores and manages a limitless variety of media assets (image, audio, video, download, etc)

**Custom navigation menus**
   Develop your own menu system, divorced from the hierarchical structure of pages on the backend

**Database query building**
   A comprehensive and easy-to-use database query class handles all your MySQL queries and result sets in a consistent manner

**User Input Sanitization**
   Scrub user-submitted data before processing, stripping out malicious code and (optionally) running HTML through HTMLTidy for cleanup

**Programmatic form generation & a WYSIWYG Form Builder**
   A simple configuration array for constructing complex forms for editing and collecting data, and a drag’n’drop editor for building and saving your own forms.

**A GUI when you want it, a script when you need it**
   Simple configurations are managed with a web interface, but you can always roll up your sleeves and write and upload the complex code yourself

**Integrated CSS Editor**
   Manage all of your stylesheets and media queries with our syntax-checking built-in Stylesheet Editor

**WYSIWYG editing**
   The popular TinyMCE editor has been customized with Manifesto-specific features for media embedding and link management

**Easy debugging**
   With the click of a button, access a wealth of data for troubleshooting your development, from the value of session variables to every single database query used to generate a page

**jQuery library**
   Extend the whizbang of your front-end with the world's most popular javascript library. It even plays nice with other libraries.

**Third-party integration**
   Custom modules, and an always-available third_party directory offers an integrated and consistent way to incorporate external libraries

**cron job support**
   Execute scripts for maintenance, cleanup, or general management on a recurring schedule, with a GUI for administration
