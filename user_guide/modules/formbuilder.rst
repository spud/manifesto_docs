The FormBuilder module is a powerful, easy-to-use way to create custom forms to present to your visitors. You can create simple text inputs, checkboxes and selection menus with custom values, long text areas, file uploads, and more!

Building a form is as simple as dragging and dropping the various components into place, and configuring them with a name, label, custom values, etc. The FormBuilder module supports default values, placeholder text, introductory copy, popup help text, and other detailed features that give you control over your forms.

While FormBuilder forms can be accessed as their own independent pages, they can also be easily embedded into any Template Page using the "Standalone Form" template. This gives you the ability to embed powerful forms directly into pages on your site, providing a fully-integrated experience.

Forms are processed upon submission, and can either display a simple confirmation message that you configure (on a form-by-form basis), or can automatically redirect the user to a page of your choosing.

Forms responses, after being submitted by visitors, are stored in a database, and can optionally be formatted and emailed to an email address. The database stores the raw response in key-value pairs, so that even if the form is edited later to add, remove, or rename fields, each response still maintains its original information, and no responses are lost.

Every form response is available for viewing in the Editor Console, but because two different forms will have two radically different sets of fields in them, you must select the form whose responses you wish to see before being able to peruse the listing of responses. Because of the complexity of creating an interface that allows you to sort the responses in various ways, Manifesto offers the ability to export and download a version of the form responses in a way that allows you to open them as a spreadsheet (e.g. in Excel), where the data can be manipulated any way you want.
